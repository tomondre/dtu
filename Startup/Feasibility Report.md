### **2. Feasibility Factors**

#### **2.1. Demand and Market Need**

- **Target Audience**: Organizations using Kubernetes and DevOps/Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams.
- **Key Problem**: Existing tools often rely on predefined alert configurations and lack proactive prediction capabilities. This platform addresses the unmet need for dynamic, AI-driven log correlation and incident prediction.

#### **2.2. Technical Feasibility**

**Key Considerations**:

1. **Telemetry Integration**:
    
    - OpenTelemetry adoption ensures data consistency and seamless integration.
    - The platform leverages existing OpenTelemetry Collectors for telemetry ingestion, reducing client-side setup complexity.
2. **LLM Capabilities**:
    
    - Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) now feature significantly larger contextual windows, resolving previous bottlenecks in processing large datasets.
    - LLMs have proven capabilities for analyzing structured and unstructured data, making them suitable for correlating logs, traces, and metrics.
3. **Scalability**:
    
    - Many cloud providers offer robust data ingestion pipelines capable of handling high-throughput telemetry data.
    - The cloud-hosted architecture ensures scalability for diverse client environments.
4. **Security Standards**:
    
    - Multiple security standards, such as encryption and anonymization, can be implemented to ensure trust.
    - While some companies may hesitate to share logs, existing services in the market operate successfully with similar models.
5. **Cost Considerations**:
    
    - While spinning up an MVP may be relatively expensive, economies of scale from cloud providers can significantly reduce costs as the platform grows.
    - A subscription-based pricing model with data limits ensures cost predictability for clients and supports sustainable growth for the platform.

#### **2.3. Team Capabilities**

- **Project Lead**: Tomas Ondrejka (AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialist, cloud-native engineer).
- **Domain Expert Advisor**: Kasper Borg Nissen (Founder at Cloud Native Nordics , cloud-native strategist).
- The team’s combined expertise ensures robust execution and alignment with industry standards.

#### **2.4. Risks and Challenges**

- **High Data Volume**:
    - **Mitigation**: Implement filtering and aggregation pipelines to manage incoming data.
- **LLM Limitations**:
    - **Mitigation**: Use deterministic checks and refine prompts for LLM processing.
- **Security Concerns**:
    - **Mitigation**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest; anonymize sensitive information.
- **Cost Concerns**:
    - **Mitigation**: Utilize cloud provider discounts and optimize data processing pipelines to reduce expenses.
