# TODO
* Open source local tools?


# Collaboration structures

## External
Steps:
1. Get legal approval for the process
2. Anonymize data set internally in Slido and create subset of it
3. Share the data set with students
4. Work on the data set on student computers and develop stuff
5. Share insights with supervisor
Open questions:
* Possible to get legal approval?
* How to ensure the data does not leave the computer? We will need to use local tools for this

## Internal
Steps
1. Create a copy of data set with the same structure but completely different values 
2. Develop stuff on student computers
3. When ready, execute stuff internally on Slido computer
4. Get legal approval for insights? Or parts of it?
5. Share insights with supervisor
Open questions:
* Will we need the approval of legal to share the insights/part of the insights with our supoervisor?
* The tools run internally in Slido will need to be local, to ensure the data does not leave the computer (could cause legal issues)
