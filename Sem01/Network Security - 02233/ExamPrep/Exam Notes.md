### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

1. **Development and Adoption**: AES was established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. It was developed by Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, and their algorithm was selected from a group of competing algorithms.
    
2. **Block Cipher**: AES is a symmetric block cipher, meaning it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It operates on fixed-size blocks of data, specifically 128 bits.
    
3. **Structure**: AES uses a substitution-permutation network structure rather than a Feistel network used by older ciphers like DES. This structure involves multiple rounds of substitution (using S-boxes) and permutation (shuffling bits) to achieve diffusion and confusion.
    
4. **Rounds**: The number of rounds in AES depends on the key size:
    
    - 128-bit key: 10 rounds
    - 192-bit key: 12 rounds
    - 256-bit key: 14 rounds
5. **Security**: AES is widely regarded as secure against all known practical attacks when used correctly. The main security consideration is the key size; longer keys offer better security.
    
6. **Efficiency**: AES is designed to be efficient both in software and hardware, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from embedded systems to high-speed network encryption.
    
7. **Galois Field Arithmetic**: AES performs arithmetic operations in a finite field (Galois field GF(2^8)), which is part of the reason for its strong security properties.
    
8. **Key Expansion**: AES includes a key expansion step where the original key is expanded into an array of key schedule, which is then used in each round of the encryption process.
    

### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

1. **History**: DES was developed in the early 1970s by IBM and later adopted as a federal standard in 1977 by the NIST.
    
2. **Block Size**: DES encrypts data in 64-bit blocks.
    
3. **Key Size**: DES uses a 56-bit key, though the original key length was 64 bits with 8 bits used for parity checks, effectively reducing the security to 56 bits.
    
4. **Rounds**: DES uses 16 rounds of a Feistel network, which involves repeated permutation and substitution operations.
    
5. **Vulnerability**: DES is considered insecure today primarily due to its short key length, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks. Advances in computing power have made it feasible to break DES with relative ease.
    

### Triple DES (3DES)

1. **Purpose**: 3DES was introduced to provide a simple method to extend the life of DES by increasing the effective key length.
    
2. **Process**: 3DES applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block. The process typically involves an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt (EDE) sequence with three different keys:
    
    - Encrypt with Key 1
    - Decrypt with Key 2
    - Encrypt with Key 3
3. **Keying Options**:
    
    - **Option 1**: All three keys are independent (effective key length: 168 bits).
    - **Option 2**: Key 1 and Key 3 are the same, but Key 2 is different (effective key length: 112 bits).
    - **Option 3**: All three keys are the same, which effectively reverts to single DES (not secure).
4. **Security**: 3DES is more secure than DES due to its longer key length but is considered inefficient and slower compared to modern ciphers like AES.
    
5. **Deprecation**: While more secure than single DES, 3DES is also considered obsolete for new systems due to its inefficiency and susceptibility to certain attacks (such as meet-in-the-middle attacks). It is being phased out in favor of AES.
    

### Counter Mode (CTR) Basics

In CTR mode, encryption and decryption are performed by combining the plaintext (or ciphertext) with a keystream generated by encrypting successive values of a counter. The keystream is produced by the following steps:

1. A nonce and a counter are concatenated to form a unique input for the block cipher.
2. This input is encrypted with the block cipher to produce a keystream block.
3. The keystream block is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext (or with the ciphertext to produce the plaintext).

### The Role of the Nonce and Counter

1. **Nonce (Number Used Once)**:
    
    - **Uniqueness**: The nonce ensures that each encryption operation uses a different initial value, even if the same key is used. This is critical to prevent the same keystream from being used for different messages.
    - **Randomness**: The nonce can be a random or a unique value for each encryption session. It does not need to be secret, but it must be unique across different encryptions with the same key.
2. **Counter**:
    
    - **Sequential Increment**: The counter is typically an incrementing value that changes with each block of data. This ensures that each block within a single message uses a different input value, producing a unique keystream block for each plaintext block.
    - **Predictability**: The counterâ€™s predictability ensures that the decryption process can generate the same sequence of keystream blocks as the encryption process.

### Why Not Just a Counter?

If only a counter were used without a nonce, several security issues could arise:

1. **Reused Keystreams**: If the same key is used for multiple messages and the counter starts from the same value each time, the same keystream will be generated for these messages. This leads to vulnerabilities like the "two-time pad" problem, where XORing the same keystream with different plaintexts can reveal information about the plaintexts.
2. **Lack of Uniqueness**: In a multi-session or multi-message scenario, without a unique starting point (nonce), different messages could end up using overlapping keystream segments, compromising confidentiality.

### Combining Nonce and Counter

By combining a nonce with a counter:

- **Ensures Uniqueness Across Messages**: The nonce provides a unique starting point for each message, ensuring that even if the same key is used, the keystream is different for each message.
- **Ensures Sequential Uniqueness Within a Message**: The counter ensures that each block within a message is encrypted with a unique keystream block.

# Message Authentication Codes (MACs)
Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are critical for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of a message in digital communications. Here are the primary purposes and benefits of using MACs for verification:

### 1. Integrity Verification

A MAC allows the recipient to verify that the message has not been altered in transit. If the message or the MAC has been tampered with, the MAC verification process will fail, indicating that the integrity of the message is compromised.

### 2. Authenticity Assurance

MACs confirm the identity of the sender. Only someone with the correct secret key can generate a valid MAC for a given message. This prevents unauthorized parties from impersonating the sender and ensures that the message comes from a legitimate source.

### 3. Detection of Modifications

MACs detect any unauthorized modifications to the message. When a message is sent, a MAC is generated using a secret key and appended to the message. Upon receipt, the recipient generates a MAC using the same secret key and compares it with the received MAC. If they match, the message is verified as unaltered. If they differ, it indicates that the message has been modified.

### 4. Protection Against Replay Attacks

MACs can also help protect against replay attacks. By including a unique sequence number or timestamp in the message, and incorporating this into the MAC, the recipient can ensure that the message is fresh and has not been replayed by an attacker.

### How MACs Work

The process of generating and verifying a MAC typically involves the following steps:

1. **Keyed Hashing**: A secret key is shared between the sender and the recipient. This key is used along with the message to generate a hash value (the MAC). Common algorithms for generating MACs include HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code), which uses hash functions like SHA-256, and CMAC (Cipher-based Message Authentication Code), which uses block ciphers like AES.
    
2. **MAC Generation**: The sender computes the MAC of the message using the secret key and appends it to the message.
    
3. **MAC Verification**: The recipient, using the same secret key, recomputes the MAC for the received message. If the computed MAC matches the received MAC, the message is verified; otherwise, it is considered tampered with or corrupted.
    

### Practical Examples of MAC Usage

- **Financial Transactions**: Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of messages in banking and payment systems to prevent fraud.
- **Software Updates**: Verifying that software patches and updates have not been tampered with before installation.
- **Secure Communications**: Protecting the integrity and authenticity of messages in secure communication protocols like TLS/SSL and IPsec.

### Summary

Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are crucial for:

- **Ensuring Integrity**: Verifying that a message has not been altered.
- **Ensuring Authenticity**: Confirming the identity of the sender.
- **Detecting Modifications**: Identifying unauthorized changes to the message.
- **Preventing Replay Attacks**: Protecting against the reuse of old messages.

# RSA
#### Overview

- **Full Name**: Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
- **Type**: Asymmetric cryptographic algorithm
- **Inventors**: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman
- **Year**: 1977

#### Purpose of RSA

The primary purpose of the RSA algorithm is to provide secure communication over an insecure channel. It achieves this by allowing:

1. **Encryption**: Protecting data confidentiality.
2. **Digital Signatures**: Authenticating the sender and ensuring data integrity.

#### How RSA Works

RSA involves two keys: a public key (for encryption) and a private key (for decryption). The security of RSA is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.

### Digital Signatures Using RSA

#### Overview
Digital signatures using RSA provide a mechanism to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of digital messages and documents. They are widely used in various security protocols and applications.
#### Purpose of Digital Signatures
1. **Authenticity**: Verify that the message or document was created by a known sender.
2. **Integrity**: Ensure that the content has not been altered since it was signed.
3. **Non-repudiation**: Prevent the sender from denying the creation or transmission of the message or document.
#### How RSA Digital Signatures Work
1. **Key Pair Generation**:
    - A pair of keys is generated: a public key and a private key.
    - The private key is kept secret by the signer.
    - The public key is distributed and available to anyone.
2. **Signing Process**:
    - **Hashing**: The message or document is hashed using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256).
    - **Encrypting the Hash**: The resulting hash value is encrypted with the signer's private key to create the digital signature.
    - **Appending the Signature**: The digital signature is appended to the message or document.
3. **Verification Process**:
    - **Hashing**: The recipient hashes the received message or document using the same hash function.
    - **Decrypting the Signature**: The digital signature is decrypted using the signer's public key to retrieve the original hash value.
    - **Comparing Hashes**: The recipient compares the decrypted hash value with the hash value of the received message. If they match, the signature is verified, ensuring authenticity and integrity.

### Cipher-Specific Attacks (e.g., RC4)

- **RC4 Attack**: RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) is a stream cipher that was widely used in SSL/TLS but is now considered insecure. Various attacks against RC4, such as the Royal Holloway attack, exploit biases in its keystream to recover plaintext. Due to these vulnerabilities, RC4 has been deprecated in all versions of TLS.

### 2. Compression Attacks (e.g., CRIME, TIME, BREACH)

- **CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy)**: This attack exploits TLS's use of data compression to leak information. By measuring the size of the compressed data, an attacker can infer the content of secret data like session cookies. This attack is mitigated by disabling compression.
    
- **TIME (Timing Info-leak Made Easy)**: This is a variant of CRIME that uses timing side channels rather than size to leak information. It exploits differences in the time it takes to process compressed data, allowing attackers to infer information about the plaintext.
    
- **BREACH (Browser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext)**: BREACH is similar to CRIME but specifically targets HTTP compression. By injecting chosen plaintext into an encrypted message and measuring the size of the compressed output, attackers can recover secrets like CSRF tokens. This can be mitigated by disabling HTTP compression or using other countermeasures.
    

### 3. Downgrade Attacks (e.g., POODLE, FREAK)

- **POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption)**: This attack exploits a vulnerability in SSL 3.0's padding mechanism. Even though SSL 3.0 is largely obsolete, some browsers and servers fall back to SSL 3.0 if TLS negotiation fails. POODLE allows an attacker to decrypt secure HTTPS connections by manipulating padding bytes.
    
- **FREAK (Factoring RSA Export Keys)**: This attack exploits a weakness in export-grade RSA ciphers. These ciphers use weak keys (512 bits), which can be factored relatively easily. Attackers can force a downgrade to export-grade RSA and then break the encryption to read or alter the contents of a secure connection. FREAK highlights the danger of supporting weak cryptographic algorithms for compatibility reasons.
    

### 4. Padding Oracle Attacks (e.g., Lucky13)

- **Lucky13**: This attack targets the implementation of the CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode in TLS. It exploits timing differences when checking the padding of decrypted messages. By carefully measuring the time it takes to process messages, an attacker can infer whether the padding was correct and gradually reveal the plaintext. This attack can be mitigated by ensuring constant-time decryption and padding checks.

### 5. Implementation Attacks (e.g., Heartbleed)

- **Heartbleed**: This is a famous vulnerability in the OpenSSL library's implementation of the TLS Heartbeat extension. It allows an attacker to read arbitrary memory from the server or client, potentially exposing sensitive information such as private keys, usernames, and passwords. The Heartbleed bug was due to a lack of bounds checking in the implementation, and it highlights the importance of rigorous testing and validation in cryptographic software.

### Mitigations and Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Ciphers**: Avoid using deprecated ciphers like RC4. Prefer modern, secure ciphers such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
2. **Disable Compression**: To protect against compression attacks like CRIME and BREACH, disable TLS-level compression and carefully manage HTTP compression.
3. **Prevent Downgrades**: Implement downgrade protection mechanisms such as TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV and use only strong protocol versions (TLS 1.2 and above).
4. **Ensure Proper Padding Handling**: Use constant-time algorithms for padding verification to prevent padding oracle attacks.
5. **Stay Updated**: Regularly update cryptographic libraries (e.g., OpenSSL) to ensure all known vulnerabilities are patched and to benefit from improved security features.

Heartbleed is an implementation-specific bug in OpenSSL, affecting the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol's heartbeat extension. The vulnerability arises from improper input validation, specifically due to a missing bounds check in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension. This results in a buffer-over-read condition, where more data than intended is read from memory.

#### Technical Details:

- **Buffer-over-read**: This type of vulnerability occurs when a program reads more data from a buffer than what is allocated. In the case of Heartbleed, an attacker could exploit this by sending a crafted heartbeat request to a vulnerable server.
- **Improper Input Validation**: The vulnerability stems from the absence of bounds checking when handling the payload length field in the heartbeat request. The heartbeat request includes a length field that specifies the size of the payload, but OpenSSL did not verify if this length was valid. An attacker could specify a larger length than the actual payload, causing the server to return more data than it should, including sensitive information from its memory.

#### Exploitation:

1. **Crafted Request**: The attacker sends a malicious heartbeat request to the server, specifying a payload length larger than the actual payload.
2. **Response**: The server, due to the missing bounds check, responds with data from its memory, beyond the original payload size.
3. **Data Leak**: This leaked data can include sensitive information such as private keys, user credentials, session tokens, and other confidential data.

#### Impact:

- **Widespread Effect**: The vulnerability had a massive impact on many high-profile websites and services, including Amazon, GitHub, Wikipedia, Tumblr, and Reddit.
- **Data Exposure**: Heartbleed allowed attackers to read up to 64KB of memory per heartbeat request, which could be repeated to gather more data.
- **Security Implications**: The exposure of private keys and session cookies could enable man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.

#### Mitigation:

- **Patch OpenSSL**: Upgrading OpenSSL to version 1.0.1g or later, or applying the provided patches, resolves the vulnerability by implementing proper bounds checking.
- **Reissue Certificates**: Due to the risk of compromised private keys, it was necessary for affected organizations to reissue and revoke old SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Update Passwords**: Users were advised to change their passwords on affected services once the vulnerability was patched to mitigate potential credential exposure.

### Steps to Execute the MITM SSL Strip Attack

#### 1. Setup and Preparation

1. **Environment**: Ensure you have a controlled environment, such as a lab network, where you can safely perform this exercise.
2. **Tools**: You will need:
    - A computer running Kali Linux (which has `ettercap` pre-installed).
    - Target client and server devices within the same network.

#### 2. Intercept Communications Using ARP Poisoning

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Poisoning** allows an attacker to intercept communication between two network devices by associating the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of the target devices.

1. **Open Terminal in Kali Linux**:
    
2. **Start `ettercap` in GUI mode**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo ettercap -G`
    
3. **Scan for Hosts**:
    
    - Go to `Hosts` > `Scan for Hosts` to discover devices on the network.
4. **Add Targets**:
    
    - Go to `Hosts` > `Hosts List`.
    - Identify the IP addresses of the target client and server.
    - Add the client to Target 1 and the server to Target 2.
5. **Enable ARP Poisoning**:
    
    - Go to `Mitm` > `ARP poisoning`.
    - Select `Sniff remote connections`.
6. **Start the Attack**:
    
    - Go to `Start` > `Start sniffing`.

#### 3. Forcing the Client to Re-establish Communication
1. **Kill Existing Connections**: To force the client to reconnect, you can terminate the current connections using a tool like `tcpkill`:
    bash
    Copy code
    `sudo tcpkill -i eth0 host <client_ip>`    
2. **Bridge Connections through Your Server**:
    - Your machine now intercepts traffic between the client and the server.
#### 4. SSL Strip Configuration
**SSLStrip** will be used to downgrade HTTPS connections to HTTP, allowing you to intercept and read the traffic in plaintext.
1. **Install SSLStrip** (if not already installed):
    bash
    Copy code
    `sudo apt-get install sslstrip`
2. **Start SSLStrip**:
    bash
    Copy code
    `sudo sslstrip -l 8080`
3. **Redirect Traffic**: Use `iptables` to redirect HTTP and HTTPS traffic to SSLStrip:
    bash
    Copy code
    `sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080 sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080`
#### 5. Monitoring and Eavesdropping on Traffic
1. **Run Wireshark**:
    - Start Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.
    - Apply filters to focus on HTTP traffic (since HTTPS will be downgraded to HTTP).
2. **Analyze Traffic**:
    - In Wireshark, apply a filter for `http` to see the plaintext traffic between the client and the server.
    - Look for sensitive information like login credentials, session cookies, etc.
### Classifications of IDSs
#### Based on the Placement (Location) of the IDS:
1. **Host-based IDS (HIDS)**:
    - **Location**: Installed on individual hosts or devices within the network.
    - **Function**: Monitors and analyzes the internals of a computing system as well as the network packets on its network interfaces.
    - **Pros**:
        - Can detect intrusions that may not be visible at the network level.
        - Provides detailed information about the specific host, including system calls, file system changes, and application activities.
    - **Cons**:
        - Can be resource-intensive, as it consumes CPU and memory on the host.
        - Limited visibility to activities occurring on other hosts.
2. **Network-based IDS (NIDS)**:
    - **Location**: Positioned at strategic points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network.
    - **Function**: Inspects incoming and outgoing network traffic and analyzes the packets for signs of malicious activity.
    - **Pros**:
        - Can monitor multiple hosts and devices on the network.
        - Provides a broader view of network activity and can detect attacks targeting multiple hosts.
    - **Cons**:
        - May not detect intrusions within encrypted traffic or within the host systems themselves.
        - Can be overwhelmed by high traffic volumes, potentially missing some attacks.
3. **Other Types**:
    - **Wireless IDS**: Focuses on monitoring wireless network traffic for signs of unauthorized access or attacks.
    - **Software-Defined Network (SDN) IDS**: Leverages SDN technology to monitor and manage network traffic for security threats in a more dynamic and programmable manner.
#### Based on the Detection Method:

1. **Signature-based IDS**:

- **Current Use**: Adoption is increasing, especially for new devices and networks that require the highest security.

## Keys in wi-fi security
### PSK (Pre-shared Key)

- **Definition**: A pre-shared key (PSK) is a shared secret, typically a passphrase, used in Wi-Fi networks to authenticate clients and access points (APs) in WPA/WPA2-Personal (also known as WPA/WPA2-PSK) mode.
- **Function**: The PSK is used during the initial authentication phase to establish a secure connection between the client and the access point.
### PTK (Pairwise Transient Key)
- **Definition**: The Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) is a key derived during the WPA/WPA2 handshake process that encrypts unicast traffic between the client (STA) and the access point (AP).
- **Derivation**: The PTK is derived using the PSK and other inputs:
    - **Formula**: PTK = PBKDF2-SHA1 (PSK + ANonce + SNonce + Mac (AA) + Mac (SA))
    - **Components**:
        - **PSK**: The pre-shared key.
        - **ANonce**: A nonce (a random number used once) generated by the AP.
        - **SNonce**: A nonce generated by the client (STA).
        - **Mac(AA)**: The MAC address of the access point (Authenticator Address).
        - **Mac(SA)**: The MAC address of the client (Supplicant Address).
    - **Function**: The PTK consists of several keys, including the EAPOL-Key Confirmation Key (KCK), the EAPOL-Key Encryption Key (KEK), and the Temporal Key (TK), which are used for encrypting and ensuring the integrity of data frames.
### ANonce (AP Nonce)
- **Definition**: ANonce stands for Access Point Nonce, a random value generated by the access point during the WPA/WPA2 handshake process.
- **Function**: It is used in the derivation of the PTK to ensure that each session has unique encryption keys, even if the PSK remains the same.

### SNonce (STA Nonce)
- **Definition**: SNonce stands for Supplicant Nonce, a random value generated by the client (supplicant) during the WPA/WPA2 handshake process.
- **Function**: It is also used in the derivation of the PTK alongside the ANonce, PSK, and MAC addresses.
### MIC (Message Integrity Code)
- **Definition**: The Message Integrity Code (MIC) is a cryptographic checksum used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of a message or data frame.
- **Function**: In WPA/WPA2, the MIC is used to protect the EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) messages exchanged during the four-way handshake, ensuring that they have not been tampered with.
### MAC (Media Access Control) Address
- **Definition**: A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.
- **Function**: MAC addresses are used to identify devices on a network. In the context of Wi-Fi security:
    - **Mac(AA)**: The MAC address of the access point (Authenticator Address).
    - **Mac(SA)**: The MAC address of the client (Supplicant Address).
	- **Role in PTK Derivation**: Both the MAC addresses of the AP and the client are used in the derivation of the PTK to ensure that the key is unique to the specific client-AP pair.

# Signal protocol
### Key Features of the Signal Protocol
1. **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient. This prevents intermediaries, including service providers, from accessing the content of the messages.
2. **Forward Secrecy**: Each message uses a unique encryption key, ensuring that even if one key is compromised, past and future messages remain secure.
3. **Future Secrecy (Post-Compromise Security)**: If an attacker gains access to a user's device, the protocol ensures that new encryption keys will be used for future messages, limiting the damage.
4. **Asynchronous Communication**: The protocol allows users to exchange messages without both being online simultaneously. This is crucial for mobile and intermittent connectivity environments.

### Core Components

1. **Double Ratchet Algorithm**: Combines the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the symmetric-key ratchet, and the hash ratchet to provide forward secrecy and post-compromise security.
    
    - **Diffie-Hellman (DH) Ratchet**: Ensures that each session key is independent and secure. Both parties generate ephemeral key pairs for each message exchange.
    - **Symmetric-Key Ratchet**: Updates keys for encryption and decryption of messages. It ensures that each message has a unique key.
    - **Hash Ratchet**: Provides additional security by hashing keys before use, ensuring they cannot be reverse-engineered.
2. **Prekeys**: Allows asynchronous communication by pre-generating a set of ephemeral key pairs. These prekeys are uploaded to a server and used when initiating a conversation.
    
3. **X3DH (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) Key Agreement Protocol**: Establishes a shared secret between two parties using three DH key exchanges. This setup allows secure communication without requiring both parties to be online simultaneously.
    
4. **AES and HMAC**: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encrypting messages and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) for integrity checks.
    

### How the Signal Protocol Works

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - Each user generates long-term identity key pairs, medium-term signed prekey pairs, and multiple one-time prekeys.
    - Users exchange these prekeys through a server.
2. **Session Setup**:
    
    - When a user wants to start a conversation, they retrieve the recipientâ€™s prekeys and perform the X3DH key agreement to establish a shared secret.
    - This shared secret seeds the Double Ratchet algorithm.
3. **Message Exchange**:
    
    - **Sending a Message**: The sender uses the Double Ratchet algorithm to derive a new encryption key for each message. The message is encrypted with AES and a MAC is computed using HMAC.
    - **Receiving a Message**: The recipient uses their ratchet state to derive the decryption key and verify the MAC, then decrypts the message.
4. **Session Maintenance**:
    
    - After each message exchange, both parties update their ratchet states, ensuring that new keys are used for future messages, maintaining forward and future secrecy.

### Advantages

- **High Security**: Robust encryption and frequent key updates make it difficult for attackers to decrypt messages, even if some keys are compromised.
- **Privacy**: No metadata is stored on the server about the content of the messages, ensuring user privacy.
- **Flexibility**: Supports asynchronous messaging, suitable for mobile environments with intermittent connectivity.

### Applications

The Signal Protocol is used in various popular messaging applications due to its strong security features. Examples include:

- **Signal App**: The original application implementing the protocol.
- **WhatsApp**: Uses Signal Protocol for encrypting messages.
- **Facebook Messenger**: Offers a "Secret Conversations" feature using Signal Protocol.
- **Skype**: Implements Signal Protocol for private conversations.

## Safety Number in Signal Protocol
Definition:
â€¢ Prekeys are public-private key pairs used in the Signal Protocol to enable secure, asynchronous communication.
Types of Prekeys:
1. Signed Prekeys:
â€¢ A public-private key pair signed by the userâ€™s long-term identity key.
â€¢ Used to authenticate the user and establish a secure channel.
â€¢ Rotated periodically (e.g., monthly).

2. One-Time Prekeys:
â€¢ Short-lived public-private key pairs intended to be used only once.
â€¢ Provide additional security through forward secrecy.
â€¢ Continuously generated and uploaded to the server.

Purpose:
â€¢ Asynchronous Communication: Allows secure communication even when the recipient is offline.
â€¢ Enhanced Security: Provides forward secrecy and post-compromise security.


# RSA vs Diffie Hellman
