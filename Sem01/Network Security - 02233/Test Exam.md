A small company hosts three database servers in their local network.

The network employs several internal firewalls to restrict access to

each database to selected employees. This policy adhere to which of

the following security design principles?

Least privilege

Separation of privilege

Fail-safe default

Economy of mechanism



Given the routing table shown below, what would be the output

interface of a packet with destination IP address '192.168.14.100'?

eth0

eth1

eth2

None of the interfaces. The packet is sent to an application running

on the router itself.


Alice is connected to her home WiFi network and a HTTPS session is

unreasonably slow. Which one of the following is not a possible

explanation?

An attacker is sniffing all the HTTPS packets.

The network is busy and the congestion control of TCP has slowed

down the flow.

The WiFi network is under a jamming attack.

The ISP of Alice is under a DDoS attack.



Which of the following frameworks can be used for auditing the

security of a network?

nmap

iptables

traceroute

john



Which of the following frameworks can be used for scanning for open

ports?

nmap

ping

tcpdump

iperf



Which of the following statements is false about NAT?

NAT hides the real IP address of the client, thus enables anonymous

Internet access.

NAT changes the addresses of the IP header before the packet is

routed to the next hop.

NAT enhances the security of home networks, because it blocks

connections initiated from the public Internet by default.

NAT can help with the problem of the exhaustion of public IPv4

addresses.



Which of the following tools can be used to implement filtering

policies on incoming network traffic?

 iptables

iperf
inbow table attack.

A DSN cache poisoning attack.



What is the problem of using block ciphers in ECB mode?

It has low diffusion, thus patterns in plaintext might be visible

in the cipher text.

It is vulnerable to brute-force attacks, because it uses small keys.

It suffers from lack of random access: if a single packet is lost,

the whole message cannot be decrypted.

The attacker can modify the first block.



Which of the following is neither a public-key exchange nor a

public-key encryption protocol?

TLS

RSA

Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange



Wireless networks are generally considered more vulnerable to

eavesdropping than wired networks. Why?

Because wireless signals can be monitored from a distance.

Because of vulnerabilities in the physical layer of IEEE 802.11

(WiFi).

Because of the ubiquity of wireless mobile devices, such as laptops

and smartphones.

Because wired protocols adopt link-layer encryption more often than

wireless protocols.



What is X.509?

A standardised format for certificates.

A standardised protocol for public key distribution.

A symmetric block cipher.

An algorithm for digital signatures using public key encryption.



TLS certificates have an expiration date. Which of the following

statement is false?

* Certificates that expired very recently (e.g. few days ago) are

still secure and safe to use.

A limited lifetime also limits the amount of time available to an

attacker to crack the private key with a brute-force attack.

The periodic re-issuing of certificates forces certification

authorities to periodically re-validate the accuracy of the

certified information, such as, for example, the ownership of the

domain name.

Expiration helps with phasing out outdated and less secure

encryption algorithms.
pying the fingerprint from an email that Bob sent from his

employer's email account.


Which tool can be used to eavesdrop unencrypted traffic that passes

through an interface?

tshark
nmap

openssl

traceroute

What is a network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?

A system that monitors the traffic in a network to detect

malicious behaviour.

A system that monitors the traffic that originates or arrives at a

host to detect malicious behaviour.

A system that blocks malicious traffic based on filtering policies.

A system that prevents intruders from accessing a network.




Which of the following statement most accurately reflect the current

status of IoT security?

*State legislation needs to catch up as certain security issues

cannot be solved with protocol implementation and security

mechanisms.

Everything is generally considered secure and all communications in

IoT are safe.

There are still open challenges which can be addressed with existing

security protocols since the IoT devices do not have any additional

resource limitations.

Encryption is not a trustworthy option
