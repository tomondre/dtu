Dear CERN Summer Student Selection Committee,

I am pleased to recommend Tomas Ondrejka for the CERN Summer Student Programme 2025. As his supervisor for a recent bachelor project and instructor in the Data Analytics and Infrastructure course at VIA University College, I have had the privilege of observing Tomas’s exceptional abilities and dedication to his field firsthand. I am confident that his technical skills, proactive approach, and commitment to excellence make him an ideal candidate for this prestigious opportunity.

Throughout the bachelor project, Tomas demonstrated his impressive analytical and problem-solving abilities, especially in the development of a system that collected Kubernetes logs and displayed them in a structured format on a web application. Tomas and his team received the highest grade, and an external examiner, after reviewing their work, expressed admiration for the project’s level of detail, even noting that it resembled industry-quality output. This achievement underscores Tomas’s technical capabilities in IT and software engineering, as well as his dedication to delivering high-quality results.

In addition to his technical skills, Tomas has shown a strong ability to tackle complex problems with creativity and resourcefulness. He has a knack for breaking down intricate challenges, collaborating effectively with his peers, and quickly finding solutions, even in high-stakes environments. His analytical mindset, combined with his knowledge of computing and software engineering, would be a great asset to CERN’s advanced IT projects.

Beyond his technical expertise, Tomas is a driven individual who takes initiative and maintains a professional and social demeanor. His eagerness to contribute, learn, and adapt within a team setting makes him well-suited to an international, collaborative environment like CERN. Tomas consistently demonstrates responsibility and a commitment to excellence in his work, qualities that I believe align strongly with CERN’s values and mission.

I fully recommend Tomas Ondrejka for the CERN Summer Student Programme. I am confident that he will excel, making a valuable contribution to CERN while also gaining experiences that will enrich his future career.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like further insights into Tomas’s qualifications. I am certain he will be a remarkable addition to the programme.

Sincerely,
