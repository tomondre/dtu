Summary:  
Motivated Computer Engineering student with a passion for technology and a focus on delivering value. Highly adaptable, growth-oriented, and capable of working effectively both independently and in collaborative team environments.

Work Experience:
* Cisco: Technical Intern - Slido (Jul 2023 - Present) Copenhagen, Denmark
	* Analyzed, designed, implemented, tested, and documented a platform for managing OAuth clients. This reduced the time engineers spent on OAuth client management to zero and accelerated the management process for Slido users by 50x.
	* Proposed, designed, and led a complex migration of data from regional to global infrastructure, eliminating redundancy and discrepancies. This included analyzing access patterns and optimizing data storage for efficient reads.
	* Initiated a collaboration between Slido and my university (DTU), bridging theoretical knowledge from classes with practical applications in a real-world product.
	* Developed custom features to enhance scalability of staging environments, significantly improving the developer experience.
	* Led the migration of existing applications to utilize token exchange for protected API resources, enhancing security and aligning with OAuth 2.0 standards. This improved the speed of user authorization on resource servers based on JWT by 10x.
	* Implemented features and resolved bugs in Slido Enterprise, improving the user experience for enterprise customers.
* Danish Business Authority: External Consultant (Aug 2023 - Dec 2023) Copenhagen, Denmark
	* Initiated a collaboration between Via University College and the Danish Business Authority for a bachelor project, which involved a group of four students.
	* Analyzed, designed, implemented, and tested a system for aggregating custom logs from a bespoke Kubernetes distribution developed by the DBA. This solution improved observability of deployed clusters, providing a holistic overview via a web interface and simplifying the developer experience by consolidating log data previously scattered across multiple sources.
	* The project received the highest academic grade.
* Qualcomm: Cloud Engineering Intern (Jul 2022 - Dec 2022) Salzburg, Austria
	* Analysed, designed, and implemented AWS CDK components for full-stack deployment of AWS Machine Images with all necessary resources, reducing configuration redundancy and speeding up CDK development by 20x. These components were used for deploying Wikitude services.
	* Designed and implemented a proof-of-concept Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS using Terraform, adhering to security best practices. This PoC served as a reference for XR Labs' transition to a unified, scalable infrastructure.
	* Developed features for the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform and Wikitude, including API modifications, frontend enhancements, and CI/CD pipeline development for infrastructure deployments.
	* Identified and patched vulnerabilities in the technology stack, reducing the potential attack surface.

Open questions:
* Are dates necessary in work experience?
* I have avoided putting position type to work experience, as part-time explicitly states that it is shorter hourly contract (and not full-time). Is this good idea?
* Does the location of work experience bring value? (internationalization)
* Does the location of education bring value? (internationalization)
