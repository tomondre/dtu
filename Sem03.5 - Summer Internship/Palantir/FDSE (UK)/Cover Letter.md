Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Forward Deployed Software Engineer (FDSE) Internship at Palantir Technologies. My technical background, hands-on experience and enthusiasm for solving real world problems align well with Palantir mission and values. In this cover letter, I will explain how my experience maps to Palantir's principles by providing real world examples.

Impact: During my internship at Cisco, I worked on a project that had a great impact on the operational workflow. I analyzed, designed, implemented and documented a platform for managing OAuth clients, which reduced the time spend on OAuth client management to zero, and accelerated the proccess for Slido users by 50x. The project signifiantly improved the proccess and streamlined the expereince, demonstrating my ability to deliver solutions that make a difference.

Ownership: For the same mentioned project, I took the lead on the entire lifecycle - from understanding the problem, creating proposals and designing the solution. Throughout the project, I maintained a single source of truth through a specification document, accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholder. This was done to ensure clarity and alignment of requirements and expectations. The ownership also extended into testing and releasing the solution finally into production. The project was successfully delivered and met the expectations of the stakeholders.

Collaboration:
At the Danish Business Authority (DBA), I led a collaborative project between DBA and my university, acting as a bridge between a team of four students and the technical team at DBA. We worked on a Kubernetes-based system for aggregating logs from custom clusters. This project required continuous communication with the DBA team, organizing feedback sessions, reviews, and in-person meetings in Copenhagen to ensure we met their expectations. Despite the technical nature of the project, I facilitated discussions that made the project understandable to everyone involved.

Growth:
Outside of work and school, I have been deeply committed to my own growth through personal projects, certifications, and community involvement. I have successfully obtained certifications in AWS Machine Learning, three AWS Associate-level certifications, Kubernetes (KCNA), and HashiCorp Terraform. Additionally, I will be attending KubeCon 2024 in Paris and regularly participate in Kubernetes Community meetups in Denmark. These experiences allow me to stay ahead of industry trends and expand my technical expertise.

In conclusion, I am confident that my skills and experiences align with Palantir’s principles of Impact, Ownership, Collaboration, and Growth. The opportunity to work on high-stakes, real-world problems that Palantir is known for excites me, and I look forward to contributing my technical abilities, collaborative spirit, and passion for growth to your team. Thank you for considering my application, and I am eager to further discuss how I can contribute to Palantir’s mission.

Sincerely,
