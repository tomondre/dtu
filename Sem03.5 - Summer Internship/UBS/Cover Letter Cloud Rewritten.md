Ofc with my ideas `d-_-b`

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the 2025 Technology Summer Internship Program at UBS. As a highly motivated and growth-oriented Computer Engineering student with a deep passion for cloud technologies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to UBS’s innovative projects and learn from a global leader in wealth management and financial services. Having an acquaintance who has worked at UBS for over five years, I have heard first-hand about the positive work environment, career development opportunities, and the collaborative culture, which further fuels my enthusiasm for joining your team.

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at DTU (Technical University of Denmark), having recently completed my Bachelor’s degree in Software Technology and Engineering at VIA University College. I expect to graduate in 2026, aligning perfectly with the timeline of this internship program. My academic background and practical work experience have provided me with a strong foundation in cloud platforms such as AWS, which I believe would allow me to make meaningful contributions to UBS's cloud infrastructure optimization projects.

In my role as a Technical Intern at Cisco Slido, I developed and deployed scalable cloud infrastructure solutions, including the migration of data to global infrastructure, which reduced redundancy and significantly improved performance. I also designed and implemented OAuth client management platforms and enhanced the security of protected API resources, aligning with best practices like OAuth 2.0 standards. These experiences have sharpened my ability to develop cloud-native applications, automate processes, and optimize performance—skills that directly align with the objectives of this internship program.

I thrive in environments that encourage collaboration and innovation, as demonstrated in my work across different roles, including at the Danish Business Authority, where I led a team of university students to design and implement a system for improving Kubernetes cluster observability. These roles have honed my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities, especially under high demands and tight deadlines.

I am particularly drawn to UBS because of its global reach and commitment to continuous improvement. I look forward to bringing my technical expertise, work ethic, and enthusiasm for learning to UBS, where I hope to contribute to exciting cloud infrastructure projects and grow under the mentorship of your talented teams. Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to further discuss how my background, skills, and experiences align with the goals of UBS.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
