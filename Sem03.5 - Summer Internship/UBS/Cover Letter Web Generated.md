Ofc with my ideas `d-_-b`

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the 2025 Technology Summer Internship Program with UBS Group Compliance, Regulatory & Governance Technology. As a motivated Computer Engineering student with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, DevOps principles, and cloud-native applications, I am eager to contribute to UBS’s innovative web applications in the Financial Crime Prevention space. Having heard positive feedback from an acquaintance who has worked at UBS for over five years, I am particularly enthusiastic about joining a team that values growth, collaboration, and cutting-edge technology.

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at DTU, set to graduate in 2026. Throughout my studies at VIA University College, I have worked extensively with Java, Spring Boot, and JPA, beginning in my first semester and continuing through various academic projects. These experiences have given me a strong understanding of object-oriented programming and the ability to develop scalable, robust applications. My familiarity with Java frameworks, combined with hands-on experience using GitLab pipelines during a project in collaboration with the Danish Business Authority, equips me to contribute effectively to your team.

In addition to my programming skills, I have a deep understanding of DevOps principles, which I have applied in both professional and academic settings. I recently attended Kubecon and have participated in several Kubernetes Community meetups, further strengthening my knowledge of cloud infrastructure and deployment practices. In my roles at Cisco and Qualcomm, I helped design and optimize cloud-native applications, ensuring they met high standards of performance and security. My work involved collaborating with cross-functional teams to enhance scalability, streamline development processes, and deploy efficient solutions—skills that will be invaluable as part of the UBS Client Reviews team.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to collaborate with senior engineers, learning from their expertise while contributing to UBS’s web applications in the Due Diligence space. I am particularly drawn to the focus on building scalable, cloud-based applications, as well as the opportunity to improve GitLab pipelines—areas where I have hands-on experience and am eager to deepen my knowledge further.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my background in Java, Spring Boot, DevOps practices, and collaborative team environments can contribute to the success of UBS’s technology initiatives. I am excited about the opportunity to grow and contribute to UBS’s 2025 Technology Summer Internship Program.
