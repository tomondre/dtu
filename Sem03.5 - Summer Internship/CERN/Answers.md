Dear Hiring Team, 
I am excited to apply for the CERN Openlab Summer Internship 2025. I am a motivated and proactive Computer Engineering student, who would love to contribute to the CERN mission.
I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark. I undertook an internship that allowed me to grow in Cloud and Backend topics. The skills I cultivated could be translated directly to help CERN initiatives, including Cloud Native technologies, Kubernetes, and backend development.
I have had the privilege of meeting several students who have previously participated in CERN's internship programs and having conversations related to their stay. The number of positive experiences overwhelmed me, motivating me to take the step myself and apply.
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to contributing to the organization.

The reason for application in the given domain was my experience and career growth in the mentioned topics. I also attend cloud computing meetups and conferences that allow me to grow in this context.
I have mentioned the most important technologies in my CV.
